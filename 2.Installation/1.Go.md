Let's  do a fresh installation of GO
==================================

1. Go is supported on different platforms such as **Windows**, **Ubuntu**, **Mac**.
2. Today, we will be installing Go on **Ubuntu/Mac**.

Follow the instructions to install on Ubuntu
==========================================
1.  bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
  <img src="https://github.com/Kedarnag13/Go-Tutorial/blob/master/2.Installation/images/gvm_installed.png">
  * This will fetch the github repo and installs it within the user directory. **.gvm** folder gets created (which would be hidden).
2.   [[ -s "$HOME/.gvm/scripts/gvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.gvm/scripts/gvm"
  * What we are doing here is linking the gvm binary to our environmental variables. This will help us run **gvm** from any path on our command line.
3. source ~/.bashrc
  * The easiest way to make the changes made in **~/.bashrc** to take effect is to restart it.  
4. gvm version
  *  Go Version Manager v1.0.22 installed at /home/kedarnag/.gvm
  * This command will return the version of **gvm** installed in the system.
5. gvm listall
  * 
  * There has been several versions of **Go** released, to check the list of all available versions.
6. gvm install go1.4.2
  * Installs the specified version of **Go**.
7. gvm use go1.4.2
  * We are telling which version of **Go** we would like to use.
8. go version
  *
