Slices
======

Arrays have their place, but they're a bit inflexible, so you don't see them too often in Go code. Slices, though, are everywhere. They build on arrays to provide great power and convenience.

The type specification for a slice is []T, where T is the type of the elements of the slice. Unlike an array type, a slice type has no specified length.

A slice literal is declared just like an array literal, except you leave out the element count:

```
letters := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}

```
A slice can be created with the built-in function called make, which has the signature,

```
func make([]T, len, cap) []T

```
where T stands for the element type of the slice to be created. The make function takes a type, a length, and an optional capacity. When called, make allocates an array and returns a slice that refers to that array.

```
len(s) == 5
cap(s) == 5

```
The zero value of a slice is nil. The len and cap functions will both return 0 for a nil slice.

A slice can also be formed by "slicing" an existing slice or array. Slicing is done by specifying a half-open range with two indices separated by a colon. For example, the expression b[1:4] creates a slice including elements 1 through 3 of b (the indices of the resulting slice will be 0 through 2).

```
b := []byte{'g', 'o', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'g'}
// b[1:4] == []byte{'o', 'l', 'a'}, sharing the same storage as b

```

The start and end indices of a slice expression are optional; they default to zero and the slice's length respectively:

```
// b[:2] == []byte{'g', 'o'}
// b[2:] == []byte{'l', 'a', 'n', 'g'}
// b[:] == b

```
