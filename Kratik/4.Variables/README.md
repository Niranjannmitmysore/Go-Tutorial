## Variables



## Variable Definition in Go:

* A variable definition means to tell the compiler where and how much to create the storage for
  the Variable

* A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows:

    var variable_list optional_data_type;


* Variables are statically typed, which means their type can't change.

* Variable names must start with a letter and may contain letters, numbers

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

**Part A:** Declare three variables that are initialized to their zero value and three declared with a literal value. Declare variables of type string, int and bool. Display the values of those variables.

**Part B:** Declare a new variable of type float32 and initialize the variable by converting the literal value of Pi (3.14).
